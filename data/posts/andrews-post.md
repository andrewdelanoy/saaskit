---

# Who am I?

Thanks for asking! My name is Andrew, I (partially) created this website, and
I'm a computer science student and Test Technician out of upstate New York.

# What will this website be for?

Some kind of SaaS. The details on that are being ironed out.

# Example

Anyone can provide software as a service, all you need is a computer and an
internet connection... And lots of time!

This is the first blog post on my website, and I'm using a SaaSKit with the Deno
TypeScript framework. In these intuitive markdown blog post files, I can even
provide javascript:

```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```
